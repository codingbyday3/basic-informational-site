    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2>Meet Alex</h2>
    <p>
       I’m Alex Carter, a 28-year-old illustrator based in Portland, Oregon. I’ve been drawing since I could hold a pencil, and over the years, I’ve transformed that passion into a career.
My style blends bold colors with clean lines, often inspired by nature, street art, and modern minimalism. When I’m not designing, you’ll find me sketching outdoors, sipping coffee at local cafés, or traveling to capture new perspectives.

    <p>
        I believe creativity is a language that connects people, and I love working with brands and individuals who want to tell their story visually.
